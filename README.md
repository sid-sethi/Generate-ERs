# Pipeline for generating expressed regions (ERs) and selecting optimal unannotated intergenic ERs

This `snakemake` pipeline identifies ERs from RNA-seq data (bigwig files) using the package [ODER](https://github.com/eolagbaju/ODER) (Optimise the Definition of Expressed Regions). The type of detected ERs is annotated by comparing to known annotation (from the provided Ensembl GTF), and the ERs are associated to their nearest gene. From this dataset, unannotated intergenic ERs within 10 kb of a protein-coding gene are selected.

# Getting Started

## Input

- Ensembl GTF annotation: http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_gtf/homo_sapiens/
- Aligned RNA-seq reads in bigwig format
 - Multiple RNA-seq replicates can be provided
 - Contig names should be UCSC style: chr1, chr2 .... chrM

## Output

The main output files generated by the pipeline are:

- `ERs/<sample_name>_ers_raw.txt` - detected ERs with meta-data
- `Intergenic_ERs/<sample_name>_3prime_intergenic_ers.txt` - filtered 3' intergenic ERs
- `Intergenic_ERs/<sample_name>_5prime_intergenic_ers.txt` - filtered 5' intergenic ERs

## Depedencies

- [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
- [snakemake](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - can be installed via conda
- The rest of the dependencies (R packages) are installed via conda.

## Installation

Clone the pipeline:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sid-sethi/Generate-ERs.git
```

## Usage

Edit `config.yml` to set the input genome, input fastq and parameters, then issue:

```bash
snakemake --use-conda -j <num_cores> all
```
